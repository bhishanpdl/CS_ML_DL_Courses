\section{Qn.1}

In this question we studied to plot the Bessel functions j0(x) and j1(x).


Pseudo-code to plot jo(x) is:
\begin{verse}
    open a file to store data\\
        if(x<=0)\\
            y = sin(x)/x\\
    close file\\ 
\end{verse}    
Caveat: There is singularity at x = 0, so we used Taylor expansion at points near x = 0.\\
Similar caution was taken to j1(x).\\
The source codes are attaced in the tar file under location:
Homeworks/qn1/

\section{Qn.2}
\subsection{part a}
A beginnig version of source code called 'cnumbers.f90' was provided.
The question asked to prepare a table of different operations of a given
complex number 'z'.
I chose r = 1 and wrote the source code, however,the code works for any other
values of r. We just have to change the value of 1 to any other value in my source
code 'qn1p1.f90'.

\subsection{part b} 

I saved the data of phi vs atan(y/x) and atan2(y,x) in a file called 'qn2WithJumps.dat'
In this code I did not account for the infinity value of tan(pi/2) or other 
integral multiples of pi/2.

I used xmgrace to plot the graph.

In next code I fixed sudden jumps about tangents of integral multiples of pi/2,
by using more points near singularity and precisely avoiding just the singularity
points.

\subsection{part c}
When I plotted the graph without taking care for infinity effect, it made
some strange jumps. Then i used more points near  a multiples of pi/2 and
avoided being precisely at a integral multiples of pi/2.
The plots are shown above.

\subsection{part d}
I am using SunStudio 12 Fortran Compiler.
It is bright enough to automatically use a complex library routine.

\subsection{part e}
From the descriptions of SunStudio 12 Fortran Libray, I found following:

\subsubsection{ sqrt function}
for a complex number
 
$z = x + iy 
$ 

the square root has also two parts,viz.,real part and imaginary part.

$ z=re^{i \phi} $
    
$ z=r cos(\phi) + r sin(\phi) $

$    \sqrt{z} = \sqrt{r} cos(\phi/2) + \sqrt{r}  sin(\phi/2) $


\subsubsection{ ln function}

$ z = r e^ {i \phi }$

$lnz = ln(r) + i * {\phi} $ 

\subsubsection{ atan(y/x) function}

The function atan(y/x) takes only ONE argument,viz. (y/x).
This is the general arc tangent function.
The function tan(pi/2) gives infinity. So atan(pi/2) gives infinity.
In the plot of atan(y/x) vs phi we get jumps at the 
integral multiples of pi/2 and fixed by taking more points near singularity and
avoiding singular point.


\subsubsection{ atan2(y,x) function}
The function atan2(y,x) takes TWO arguments,viz. y and x.
This is different than arc tangent function.
In our case,

The function tan(pi/2) gives infinity. So atan2(y,x) gives infinity in such cases.
In the plot of atan2(y,x) vs phi we get jumps at the 
integral multiples of pi/2 and fixed by taking more points near singularity and
avoiding singular point.

\section{Qn.3}
In this exercise we examined the power series for the exponential function exp(-x)

\subsection{part a}
The whole source code is given inside /Homeworks/assign1/q3/qn3bad.f90

the pseudo-code to calculate exp(-x) is following:

program expnbad

define variables

write table headers

!use do while loop for different values of x
    
    x = 0.01d0           ! initialize the value of x to be changed later

            sum = sum + term
            
        end do
        
        ratio = abs(sum - exp(-x))/sum ! given in the question
             
        write(kwrite,100) x,term,sum,ratio

The corrected code fragment for good way is following:

    x = 0.01d0           ! initialize the value of x to be changed later

            term = term*(-x)/float(n) 
            
            sum = sum + term
            
        end do

\subsection{part b1}
The illustration of underflow of numbers when using bad way and good way is
presented above.

\subsection{part b2}
The table for bad code as well as table for good code was produced.

\subsection{part b3}
I used built in function 'time' in the bash command to find the 
time of compilation. Also i used $'call cpu_time()'$ inside fortran code 
to find the time of compilation.
