\section{Qn.1}

In this question we studied to plot the Bessel functions j0(x) and j1(x).


Pseudo-code to plot jo(x) is: //
    open a file to store data //
        if(x<=0)//
            y = sin(x)/x//
    close file 
    
Caveat: There is singularity at x = 0, so we used Taylor expansion at points near x = 0.
Similar caution was taken to j1(x).
The source codes are attaced in the tar file under location:
