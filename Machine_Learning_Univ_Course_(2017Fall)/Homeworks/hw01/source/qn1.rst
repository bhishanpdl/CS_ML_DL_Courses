Univariate Linear Regression
=============================

In this question we fit the linear regression model to find the house prices
of Athens, Ohio based on the floor size of the house. The source code is
given under the heading Source Codes. Here I am presenting the outputs.

Outputs::

  Params Univariate:  [[-15682.27021631]
   [   115.41845202]]

  Univariate Regression
  E_rms_train Univariate: 6.41e+04
  J_train Univariate: 2.05e+09
  E_rms_test Univariate: 6.58e+04
  J_test Univariate: 2.16e+09


The plot of best fit is given below.
