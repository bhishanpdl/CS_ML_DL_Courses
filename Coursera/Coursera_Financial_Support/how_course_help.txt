I am an astrophysicist by study but in the meantime, I have taken a large number of courses from Coursera and from my university on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I am more interested in building a career in Industry than going for Post-doc. I have been applying for the job for the last year and due to pandemic and the rarety of job openings, I have not been able to get the job so far.
Many job openings have the requirement of Agile and Jira and if I have these skills, I hope this would increase my probability of getting a job. I have been taking university classes on my own expenses and I would like to join a job as soon as possible. I hope this agile certificate will help me find a job and help my financial condition. If I get financial support, that would be a great help and rescue me a little bit from the financial burden.
